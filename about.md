#### About me 

I live in Amsterdam together with my wife and 2 boys. I co-founded inSided in 2011 and have been involved in all technical aspects of our beautifull SaaS platform. Just recently I have made a pivot of moving more towards the external market instead of all the internal stuff that is going on. Still trying to get used to that but it is surely something that gives a lot of energy!
