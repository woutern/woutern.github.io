{#### About me 

I live in Amsterdam together with my wife and 2 boys. I co-founded inSided in 2011 and have been involved in all technical aspects of our beautifull SaaS platform. Just recently I have made a pivot of moving more towards the external market instead of all the internal stuff that is going on. Still trying to get used to that but it is surely something that gives a lot of energy!

### Why inSided

I have communities written in my DNA. No really, I think that if you would look at my DNA in one of those fancy machines they can actually read the word 'community' in a string of that beautifull stuff. 

In 1999 I started my first community (about mobile products/services) which I was able to grow towards a real company with a massive amount of real (super)users that were very hel[ing each other out and actually started to organise meetings, gatherings and other events. I was mainly working on new features for the community myself and eventually gathered some developers around me to help out. I sold the company a couple of years ago. 

Seeing a community grow from nothing to a self-sustaining community, with real people that got real ROI in regards to the time they invested in the community, opened my eyes. I truly believe that bringing end-users of products and services together in a single space
